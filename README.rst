purl-validator
================================

PURLs are everywhere in SBOMs. But with adoption comes widespread errors. 
A recent study on the quality of SBOMs revealed that for many proprietary and
open source tools, PURLs in SBOMs are inconsistent, fake, incorrect, or 
misleading. This is a serious problem to any application of SBOMs for 
cybersecurity and application security, as well as related compliance 
regulations. This project is to create a PURL validator that's decentralized 
such that libraries can use it offline and help them create better PURLs.

Building this compact dataset is new territory. There is research 
and exploration necessary for creating a super compact data structure 
that is also easy and fast to query across multiple languages. The data 
structure will also need memory-mapping to avoid running out of memory.
